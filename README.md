 ## Overview
 VR Slide Ride is a revolutionary app that is built for Android and the Google Cardboard VR platform. A user uploads a PPT to "http://vrslideride.tech/" or "https://zhangtom54321.github.io/vrslideridewebsite/" and is given a code. The user then opens this app and types in the code to view the PPT in 360 degree virtual reality!
  
This app, along with its website, was built on 11/4/17 - 11/5/17 in 24 hours at Firebird Hacks in Fremont, CA.

The website's Github Repositories can be found at "https://github.com/zhangtom54321/vrslideridewebsite"
