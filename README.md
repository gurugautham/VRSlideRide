 ## Overview
 VR Slide Ride is a revolutionary app that is built for Android and the Google Cardboard VR platform. A user uploads a PPT to "http://vrslideride.tech/" or "https://zhangtom54321.github.io/vrslideridewebsite/" and is given a code. The user then opens this app and types in the code to view the PPT in 360 degree virtual reality!
